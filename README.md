# Python-Training
A repository showcasing my Python journey from foundational topics like functions and loops to data science and machine learning. It includes hands-on examples using libraries such as NumPy, BeautifulSoup, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy, all organized in Jupyter notebooks for a practical learning experience.
